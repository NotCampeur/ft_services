When announcing in layer2 mode, one node in your cluster will attract traffic for the service IP.
From there, the behavior depends on the selected traffic policy.

With the default Cluster traffic policy, kube-proxy on the node that received the traffic does load-balancing,
and distributes the traffic to all the pods in your service.

By default, Services do not share IP addresses. If you have a need to colocate services on a single IP,
you can enable selective IP sharing by adding the metallb.universe.tf/allow-shared-ip annotation to services.

The value of the annotation is a “sharing key.” Services can share an IP address under the following conditions:

    They both have the same sharing key.
    They request the use of different ports (e.g. tcp/80 for one and tcp/443 for the other).
    They both use the Cluster external traffic policy, or they both point to the exact same set of pods
																	(i.e. the pod selectors are identical).
