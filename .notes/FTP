Active Mode:
    The client issues a PORT command to the server signaling that it will 
    “actively” provide an IP and port number to open the Data Connection back to the client.

Passive Mode:
    The client issues a PASV command to indicate that it will wait
    “passively” for the server to supply an IP and port number,
    after which the client will create a Data Connection to the server.


DOWNLOADING | UPLOADING : 

    Before downloading a file, we should set the local FTP file download directory by using 'lcd' command

    If you dont specify the download directory, the file will be downloaded
    to the current directory where you were at the time you started the FTP session.

    Now, we can use the 'get' command to download a file

    To download several files we can use wildcards:
        "mget *.xls"

    We can upload files that are in the local directory where we made the FTP connection.

    To upload a file, we can use 'put' command.

    When the file that you want to upload is not in the local directory,
    you can use the absolute path starting with "/"

    To upload several files we can use the mput command similar to the mget example from above:
        mput *.xls
